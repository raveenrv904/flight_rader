## Overview

This Flight Radar project displays real-time flight locations on a map and allows users to retrieve details for specific flights. The application uses [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) for mapping and integrates with a flight data API to fetch real-time flight information. Built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for a fast and efficient development experience.

## Features
